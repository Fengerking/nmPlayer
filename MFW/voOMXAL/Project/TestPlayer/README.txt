Setup step:

1)This sample app requires H264,AAC file to be placed in /sdcard/dump.aac dump.H264, you can get these two files at ./VOLibrary

2)Maybe you need copy libvoTsFW.so and libvoOMXALWrapp.so  from ./VOLibrary into /data/data/com.example.nativemedia/lib

3)Open app,select a video surface,click Start/Pause native MediaPlayer,not Java MediaPlayer
